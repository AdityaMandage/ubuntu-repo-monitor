# 🆓 GitHub Actions Setup - Free 24/7 Monitoring!

GitHub Actions gives you **2000 minutes/month FREE** - enough for checking every 30 minutes 24/7!

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. **Create GitHub Repository**
```bash
# Go to github.com and create a new repository
# Name it something like: ubuntu-repo-monitor
# Make it public (required for free Actions)
```

### 2. **Upload Your Files**
Upload these files to your GitHub repository:
- `.github/workflows/monitor.yml`
- `github_monitor.py` 
- `requirements.txt`
- `README.md`

### 3. **Initialize Log Directory**
Create an empty `logs/` directory in your repo:
```bash
# In your repo, create:
logs/.gitkeep
```

### 4. **Push and Activate**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Ubuntu repository monitor setup"
git push
```

**That's it!** GitHub Actions will automatically:
- ✅ Run every 30 minutes
- ✅ Check all 3 Ubuntu repositories  
- ✅ Log any updates
- ✅ Commit changes back to your repo
- ✅ Work 24/7 without your laptop

## 📧 **Adding Email Notifications** (Optional)

Want to get emailed when updates happen? Add this to your workflow:

```yaml
    - name: Send Email Notification
      if: steps.monitor.outputs.updates == 'true'
      uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3
      with:
        server_address: smtp.gmail.com
        server_port: 587
        username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
        subject: "Ubuntu Repository Update Detected!"
        body: "New Ubuntu package updates detected. Check the logs for details."
        to: your-email@gmail.com
        from: GitHub Actions
```

Then add these secrets in your repo settings:
- `EMAIL_USERNAME`: Your Gmail address
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your Gmail app password

## 🔍 **How to Check Results**

1. **Go to your GitHub repo**
2. **Click "Actions" tab**
3. **See all monitoring runs**
4. **Check the "logs/" directory** for update history

## 💰 **Cost Calculation**

- **Each check**: ~2 minutes
- **Every 30 minutes**: 48 checks/day = 96 minutes/day
- **Per month**: ~2880 minutes/month
- **GitHub free tier**: 2000 minutes/month
- **Overage cost**: $0.008/minute = ~$7/month if you exceed

**Solution**: Check every 45 minutes instead of 30 = stays within free tier!
